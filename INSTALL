pam_tacplus consists of the module code and `libtac' simple TACPLUS+ library.

Simple `./configure' followed by `make' should compile both TACACS+ library and pam_tacplus module.
If there is no ./configure create one with autotools:

$ aclocal
$ autoconf 
$ autoheader 
$ automake --add-missing


You should get a `pam_tacplus.so' module, which is placed in
/usr/local/lib/. Move it to the right security dir, normally /lib/security/.
Modify `sample.pam' and install it in /etc/pam.d under
name of the proper service.

This code is known to work on Linux, Solaris and AIX for now.
