pam_tacplus consists of the module code and `libtac' simple TACPLUS+ library.

Simple `make' should compile both TACACS+ library and pam_tacplus module.
If not, you could try to edit the following files:

./Makefile
./libtac/lib/Makefile

You should get a `pam_tacplus.so' module, which should be placed in
/lib/security. Modify `sample.pam' and install it in /etc/pam.d under
name of the proper service.

This code is known to work on Linux, Solaris and AIX for now.
